The Commodore 64 is a personal computer released in 1982. It is the precursor of the (unreleased) C65 which is the machine the MEGA65 is recreating. It is usually abbreviated as just **C64**.

The core for the C64 is nearly 100% compatible to a real C64. Hardware like cartridges and floppy drives can be plugged into the MEGA65 and will work.
The core can load disk images (.d64 files) and cartridge images (.crt files) from any of the two SD Cards in the MEGA65. Tape images are not supported.
The Core only supports a PAL C64 system. Programs that only work correctly on NTSC (USA/Japan) systems are not compatible. Please see all details in the documentation.

The Core is available in versions for R3 and R6 boards.

The ZX Spectrum Core for the MEGA65 is a port of the ZX-UNO project to the MEGA65 framework. It needs to be carefully setup and requires specific files and directories on the SD Card. It can run most ZX Spectrum software and uses .tap files. The Core is not as user-friendly as the C64 core, as the Spectrum uses a different keyboard layout, has specific options for Joysticks (the original ZX Spectrum did not have a joystick port so games have options for different hardware extensions) and sometimes need some extra help in configuring specific games.

The Core is available in versions for R3 and R6 boards
