* Turn the MEGA65 off.
* Copy the `.cor` file for your Model of the MEGA65 on a Micro-SD card and insert it into the MEGA65 (either internal or external slot).
* Press and hold the <kbd>NO SCROLL</kbd> key in the top row at position 5.
* Turn on your MEGA65.
* You should now see a list of 8 slots, numbered 0 to 7. You can install a Core into any of these, but it is recommended to keep Slot 1 for the MEGA65 core. You can simply overwrite the contents of any slot with new versions or different Cores.
* Press the <kbd>CTRL</kbd> key and the number of the slot you want to install to.
* Select the `.cor` file for the Core on your Micro-SD-Card and confirm installation.
* Do not reset or turn off the MEGA65 for the next minute or two until you see a confirmation message on screen.

## How do I run an alternative MEGA65 core?

* Turn off your MEGA65.
* Press and hold the <kbd>NO SCROLL</kbd> key in the top row at position 5.
* Press the number key of the slot of the core you want to start.
* When you reset the MEGA65 with the Reset button, the Core you have chosen will stay active. If you turn the MEGA65 off and on again without pressing <kbd>NO SCROLL</kbd>, the Core Slot defined as the default core will be loaded and run.
